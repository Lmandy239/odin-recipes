    </p>

    <p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to a temperature of 350 degrees Farenheit. Grease and flour cake pan or line<br>
        it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>

        <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth using a fork or a potato masher.</li>

        <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light <br>
        and fluffy. You can use an electric mixer or beat by hand with a whisk.</li>

        <li>Add the eggs one at a time to the butter-sugar mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir<br>
        in the vanilla extract if desired.</li>

        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>

        <li>Gradually add the ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture, alternating with the mashed bananas<br>
        Mix together until combined. Avoid overmixing, as it can result in a denser texture.</li>

        <li>If the batter seems too thick, you can add a small amount of milk to it.</li>

        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading evenly.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30-35 minutes.</li>

        <li>Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>You may add frosting or toppings of your liking.</li>
        
        <li>Finally, take a seat and just enjoy your fresh Banana cake!.</li>
