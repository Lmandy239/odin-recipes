            <b>Steps:</b>
        </h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks for about 60 seconds until light yellow and increased in <br>
                volume, then whisk in the cornstarch and about 1/4 cup of the milk. Once smooth and incorporated,<br>
                set aside.</li>

            <li>Place the sugar, cocoa, salt, and remaining milk in a saucepan, and bring to a scald over medium-high<br>
                 heat, which is when the liquid is about 180-190ÂºF. This is before the mixture comes to a boil, and in<br>
                  this stage you will see little bubbles start forming on the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the<br>
                   heat and, while whisking constantly, dribble the hot cocoa into the egg cornstarch mixture very<br>
                    gradually. We are tempering so we don't scramble the eggs. Pour everything back into the saucepan<br>
                     and cook over medium high heat, whisking constantly, until the pudding comes to a full boil. <br>
                     Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue whisking for a couple minutes until the pudding is thickened.</li>

            <li>Remove the pudding from the heat and stir in the chocolate or vanilla extract. Pour the pudding into a bowl<br>
                 and press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding so a skin doesn't form. Refrigerate for an hour<br>
                  or two until chilled. Serve and enjoy!</li>
